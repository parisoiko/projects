# projects
These are some projects that I've worked in whilst in bootcamps/university.


1. Contacts editor is a very simple one day project that I learned to make while training in my first steps of Javascript.

2. Contacts editor with JSON is my first project where I implemented KnockOut-JS. It also implements save-load functions via session storage.

3. The eShop app with Javascript is a week-long project I created at bootcamp when I put all my front-end knowledge to use.
